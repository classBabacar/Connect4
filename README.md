# Inspiration 

This is one of my favorite games. Growing up I played this game so much with family and friends I took a lot of L's 
but once I understood a bit more about programming I had to make this game because it means so much to me.

# Goals
Right now, the game allows for 1v1 play but in the near future I plan to incorporate an AI with the concept of MinMax.

I recommend that you compile with ``g++ *.cc ``
Run with ``./a.out``
