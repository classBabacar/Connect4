# Inspiration 

This is one of my favorite games. Growing up I played this game so much with family and friends I took a lot of losses and that's why I kind of got obsessed with the game
because I hate losing. So I practiced a lot of programming so one day I could make this game now I did but now I have another goal which is the AI...

# Goals
Right now, the game allows for 1v1 play but in the near future I plan to incorporate an AI with the concept of MinMax.

# Game Updates
I had to refactor the whole code because if I wanted to incorporate an AI my previous method would not be a suitable starting place but now I believe I am in good condition to implement an AI..see ya soon

# Features Added
Rematch Option

# Running Code

I recommend that you compile with ``g++ *.cc ``
Run with ``./a.out``
